# Personal Portfolio
A small project i'm doing during the academy hosted by FormaTemp/Alpenite. It's my personal portfolio. <br>
I developed it mobile first so technically it should be very mobile friendly <br>
I especially tried to improve my understanding of how animations work.<br>
3rd party libraries used: <br>
Animation.css <br>
Motion.js <br>
JS Waypoints <br>
jQuery/Bootstrap4/SCSS <br>
